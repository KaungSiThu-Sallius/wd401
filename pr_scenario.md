<h2>#Handling Code Review Feedback</h2>

// Code snippet<br>
function calculateSum(nums) {
let result = 0;
for (let num of nums) {
result = result + num;
}
return result;
}

// Feedback<br>
The code you provide can effect the performance of the project if it becomes too big. Consider any alternative built-in methods to handle the looping.

Got the feedback -> Think the code process again -> change the logic of the code -> test the newly changed code -> create the pull request -> review by other team members
